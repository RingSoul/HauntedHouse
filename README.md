# HauntedHouse
An interactive text-based game that allows the user to explore a Haunted House and reach different endings.

This game starts at the "start_page.html" in the "location" folder.

This game does not involve much "jump scare" elements; possible disturbing content includes: 
* An image of a real spider

The game additionally contains references to the content of many book I have read, such as:
* One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez
* As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner
* Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng
* etc.

**Acknowledgements**: This project's originality is solely involved in the structuring of the Haunted House and the text descriptions.  Images come from the Internet (attributions included in the JS files of the "page_data" folder); the references to the content of different books, although self-interpreted or partially modified, is not a part of originality (attributions to the books are above).
